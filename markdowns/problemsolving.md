**10.3 Fix Memory leaking**
- [x] Fix memory leaks in canary rollout services (added shutdown methods)
- [x] Add proper cleanup for timers and intervals (completed)
- [x] Fix test setup to prevent memory leaks (completed)
- [ ] Test memory leak fixes (BLOCKED - Jest timer detection issue)

**10.4 Fix memory leaking cont.**
Read through the entire codebase and evaluate possible memory leak spots and issues.

- [x] Identify all places where timers (`setInterval`, `setTimeout`) are used and confirm they are cleared with `clearInterval` or `clearTimeout`.
- [x] Look for event listeners that may not be removed properly (`.on`, `.addEventListener`) and confirm they have corresponding `.off` or `.removeEventListener`.
- [x] Check for open file handles, network requests, or database connections that may not be closed properly.
- [x] Review global variables or caches that may keep references alive longer than necessary.
- [x] Inspect async operations (like `fs`, `child_process`, or external APIs) to confirm proper cleanup.
- [x] Provide a report listing:
   - Specific file and line numbers of potential leaks.
   - Why the issue could cause a memory leak or unclosed handle.
   - Recommendations on how to fix or mitigate the issue.
- [x] Highlight any potential security or stability vulnerabilities related to resource management.
