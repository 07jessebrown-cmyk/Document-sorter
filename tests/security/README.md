## Running Tests

### Run All Security Tests
```bash
npm run test:security
```

### Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Security test suite
npm run test:security:unit

# Penetration testing
npm run test:security:penetration

# Integrity verification
npm run test:security:integrity

# Deployment validation
npm run test:security:deployment
```

### Run with Coverage
```bash
npm run test:security:coverage
```

### Run in CI/CD Pipeline

npm run ci:security
```

## Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`)
- Configured for security testing with appropriate timeouts
- Sequential execution for better isolation
- Coverage reporting for security services
- Custom setup and teardown

### Global Setup (`global-setup.js`)
- Creates necessary test directories
- Sets up test environment variables
- Initializes security test environment

### Global Teardown (`global-teardown.js`)
- Cleans up test directories

- Resets environment variables

## Test Reports

### Comprehensive Security Report
The test runner generates detailed reports including:

- **Executive Summary**: Overall test results and status
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Critical, high, medium, and low severity issues
- **Task Results**: Status of each Phase 8 task
- **Test Suite Results**: Individual test suite performance
- **Recommendations**: Security recommendations based on test results
- **Next Steps**: Actionable next steps based on overall status

### Report Formats
- **JSON Report**: `phase8-security-validation-final-report.json`
- **Markdown Summary**: `phase8-security-validation-summary.md`
- **JUnit XML**: For CI/CD integration

## Test Environment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+

- Test data and mock services
- Temporary directory permissions

### Test Data
- Sample files for integrity testing
- Mock user accounts for authentication testing
- Test client data for isolation testing

## Continuous Integration

### CI/CD Integration
The security tests are designed to integrate with CI/CD pipelines:

- **Pre-deployment Testing**: Run security tests before production deployment
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate security reports for review
- **Failure Handling**: Appropriate exit codes for CI/CD systems
- **Coverage Reporting**: Security test coverage metrics

### Security Gates
Tests include security gates that must pass before deployment:

- No critical vulnerabilities
- All authentication tests pass
- File integrity verification passes
- Access control validation passes
- Audit logging integrity verified

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Test Monitoring
- Real-time test execution monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and reporting
- Test result trending

### Security Alerts
- Critical vulnerability detection
- Failed security test alerts
- Performance degradation alerts
- Configuration drift detection

## Best Practices

### Test Development
- Write comprehensive test cases
- Include both positive and negative test scenarios
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Maintain test data consistency

### Security Testing
- Regular penetration testing
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Security code review integration
- Threat modeling validation

### Maintenance
- Regular test updates
- Security test review
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Test Timeouts**: Increase timeout values for slow tests
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure proper file system permissions
- **Memory Issues**: Adjust Node.js memory limits
- **Service Dependencies**: Verify all security services are available

### Debug Mode
Run tests in debug mode for detailed output:
```bash
DEBUG=security:* npm run test:security
```

### Test Isolation
Each test suite runs in isolation to prevent interference:
- Separate temporary directories
- Independent test data
- Cleanup after each test
- No shared state between tests
