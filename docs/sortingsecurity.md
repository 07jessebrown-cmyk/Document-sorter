8. **Resource limitation & monitoring** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
   - Priority: Medium  
   - Action: Enforce CPU, memory, and disk quotas per sandbox. Monitor for anomalies or abuse.  
   - Milestone: Resource exhaustion attacks mitigated.
   - **Status:** Resource limits implemented with CPU, memory, and disk quotas per container. Monitoring and alerting system configured for resource abuse detection.

---

### Phase 4: Access Controls & Authentication ✅ **COMPLETED**
9. **Implement strict authentication** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
   - Priority: High  
   - Action: Require strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and OAuth/OIDC where possible.  
   - Milestone: Only authorized users can access the system.
   - **Status:** AuthenticationService implemented with strong password policies, bcrypt hashing, MFA support using TOTP, session management, and account lockout protection. File created: `src/services/authenticationService.js`

10. **Role-based access control (RBAC)** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
    - Priority: High  
    - Action: Enforce per-client access; users can only access their own files.  
    - Milestone: Cross-client access fully blocked.
    - **Status:** RBACService implemented with role-based permissions, per-client access control, custom role creation, and comprehensive permission validation. File created: `src/services/rbacService.js`

11. **Service-to-service access control** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
    - Priority: Medium  
    - Action: Limit inter-service communications using API keys or service identity tokens.  
    - Milestone: Least-privilege enforced between services.
    - **Status:** ServiceAuthService implemented with API key management, JWT tokens for service authentication, permission-based access control, and rate limiting. File created: `src/services/serviceAuthService.js`

### Phase 5: Audit Logging and Tamper Detection ✅ **COMPLETED**
12. **Implement immutable audit logging** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
    - Priority: High  
    - Action: Store logs in WORM storage or append-only ledger (e.g., blockchain-style or cloud-native immutable logs).  
    - Milestone: All actions (uploads, downloads, processing) are logged and tamper-proof.
    - **Status:** AuditLoggingService implemented with blockchain-style hash chaining, WORM storage capabilities, comprehensive event logging, and tamper-proof integrity verification. File created: `src/services/auditLoggingService.js`

### Phase 6: Least-Privilege Principle
