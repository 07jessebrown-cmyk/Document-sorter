# Document Sorter App — Cross-Platform Packaging & Fix for Missing Module

**Goal:** Ensure the packaged Electron/Tauri app works seamlessly on both macOS (`.dmg`) and Windows (`.exe`) without missing module errors (e.g., `pdf-parse`).  
**Format:** Numbered, actionable tasks for Cursor agent to execute.

---

## Phase 1 — Dependency Audit ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Verify Dependencies** ✅
   - Open `package.json`.
   - Ensure all runtime libraries (`pdf-parse`, `fs-extra`, etc.) are listed in `"dependencies"`, not `"devDependencies"`.
   - ✅ Output: `"pdf-parse"` and others confirmed under `"dependencies"`.

2. **Install Dependencies** ✅
   - Run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Confirm `node_modules/pdf-parse` exists locally.
   - ✅ Output: Dependencies installed.

---

## Phase 2 — Packaging Configuration ✅ COMPLETED
3. **Update Electron Builder Config (Cross-Platform)** ✅
   - In `package.json` (or `electron-builder.yml`), ensure:
     ```json
     "build": {
       "asar": true,
       "files": [
         "dist/**/*",
         "src/**/*",
         "node_modules/**/*",
         "package.json"
       ],
       "asarUnpack": [
         "node_modules/pdf-parse"
       ],
       "mac": {
         "target": "dmg"
       },
       "win": {
         "target": "nsis"
       }
     }
     ```
   - ✅ Output: Config ensures correct bundling for both macOS and Windows.

4. **Windows-Specific Considerations** ✅
   - Add `win` build config:
     - `target: nsis` → creates `.exe` installer.
     - Ensure `extraResources` includes any native DLLs if required.
   - ✅ Output: Windows installer configuration added.

---

## Phase 3 — Rebuild & Test ✅ COMPLETED
5. **Clean Previous Builds** ✅
   - Run:
     ```bash
     rm -rf dist build release
     ```
   - ✅ Output: Old artifacts removed.

6. **Build for macOS** ✅
   - Run:
     ```bash
     npm run dist -- -m
     ```
   - ✅ Output: `.dmg` installer built.

7. **Build for Windows** ✅
   - Run (on Windows or cross-compile with CI):
     ```bash
     npm run dist -- -w
     ```
   - ✅ Output: `.exe` installer built.

---

## Phase 4 — Runtime Verification ✅ COMPLETED
8. **Sanity Check pdf-parse** ✅
   - In `main.js`, add temporary check:
     ```js
     try {
       require("pdf-parse");
       console.log("✅ pdf-parse loaded successfully");
     } catch (e) {
       console.error("❌ pdf-parse failed to load", e);
     }
     ```
   - Run packaged app.
   - ✅ Output: Console logs confirm working dependency.

9. **Test File Processing** ✅
   - Process a sample PDF on both macOS and Windows installers.
   - ✅ Output: App parses PDF correctly on both platforms.

---

## Phase 5 — Automation ✅ COMPLETED
10. **Set Up CI/CD Builds** ✅
    - Use **GitHub Actions**:
      - macOS runner → `.dmg`
      - Windows runner → `.exe`
    - Artifacts uploaded to GitHub Releases.
    - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Created comprehensive CI/CD setup:
      - `build.yml` - Continuous integration for all platforms
      - `release.yml` - Automated releases on git tags
      - `test.yml` - Testing and validation across platforms
      - All workflows configured for macOS, Windows, and Linux
      - Artifacts automatically uploaded to GitHub Releases
    - ✅ Output: Both installers built automatically.

---

## Success Criteria ✅ ALL ACHIEVED
- ✅ App installs cleanly on macOS and Windows.  
- ✅ No `Cannot find module 'pdf-parse'` errors.  
- ✅ File processing works identically across both platforms.  
- ✅ CI/CD builds produce `.dmg` and `.exe` installers automatically.
